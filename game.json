        "text": "Haru and I arrive at the theater in Central Street and grab our seats as the movie began. It is a chick-flick about a knight who helps a princess out of an arranged marriage made by the king and the knight ends up marrying the woman himself. Haru could not stop crying during the film. We walk out into the lobby after the movie is over and talk about it for a while. Haru then expresses how she sometimes feel like that she is the princess from the film and is waiting for her knight in shining armor. I tell her that he might be closer than she thinks. It is getting late... I should escort Haru back to the station and head home.\n[[Go home|LeBlanc]]",
